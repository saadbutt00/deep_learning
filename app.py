# Introduction Section

### Introduction
This model recognizes traffic signs using a deep learning approach. 
The dataset used for training the model is the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**, which consists of 43 different traffic sign classes. 
This model helps identify traffic signs and their corresponding meanings, which can be useful in building autonomous driving systems and other safety applications.

#### How to use:
- Upload an image of a Traffic Sign.
- The model will predict Traffic Sign.

# Upload image using Streamlit (both upload button & drag-and-drop)

        img = Image.open(uploaded_file)
        img = img.convert('RGB')  # Ensure the image is in RGB mode

    # Predict the class
    prediction = model.predict(img_array)
    predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]  # Get the class with the highest probability
    predicted_label = labels[predicted_class]  # Map class to label

### Conclusion
This model has been trained on a diverse set of traffic signs, achieving high accuracy in predicting the correct sign. The accuracy of the model depends on factors such as the quality of the image and the clarity of the sign in the image. This model can help in applications such as autonomous driving systems, road safety applications, and assistive technologies for drivers.
